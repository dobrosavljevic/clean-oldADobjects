<#
    A script that looks through an Active Directory for objects (computers and users)
    that haven't logged into it for more then 90 days. If any objects are found they
    are moved to respective OUs.

    If the script locates any objects that are disabled and that haven't been logged
    into for longer then a year the script should completely remove the objects from
    the active directory.

    Latest Version:
        https://github.com

    Usage:
        This script is inteded to be deployed with Ninja RMM to clients with a managed
        services agreement. Alternatively it can be ran manually on servers that
        support PowerShell.

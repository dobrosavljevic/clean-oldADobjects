<#
    A script that looks through an Active Directory for objects (computers and users) and
    disables and moves them to a placeholder OU if they haven't logged into the Active Directory
    for a predetermined amount of time (90 day suggested time frame).

    Further, if the script locates any objects inside the placeholder OUs that are disabled and
    that haven't logged into the Active Directory for longer then a year the script
    should permanently remove the objects from the active directory.

    All of the script's actions should be logged into the domain controller's Event Log.

    Latest Version:
        https://github.com/dobrosavljevic/clean-oldADobjects/blob/master/clean-oldADobjects.ps1

    Usage:
        This script is inteded to be deployed with Ninja RMM to domain controllers and
        automatically executed on a regular schedule.
        
        Alternatively it can be ran manually on servers that support PowerShell script exectuion.
